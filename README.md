Cross Validation was used to test whether a logistic regression model would be useful for such data.
False positives, points classified as good applicants when their true response value is bad are five
times worse than false negatives, points classified as bad applicants when their true response value
is good. The goal was to find a model that minimized the costs of errors while maximizing accuracy. 
The first model using all attributes minimized costs and maximized accuracy more than the second model.
The first model had a tested accuracy of 79% when classifying loan applicants.
