False positives, points classified as good applicants when their true response value is bad are five
times worse than false negatives, points classified as bad applicants when their true response value
is good. The goal was to find a model that minimized the costs of errors while maximizing accuracy. 
The first model using all attributes minimized costs and produced a smaller minimum cost when tested
on the validation set. However, when applying the model on the testing data, model one had a much
higher variance than model two. Therefore, the second model with less factor would be my chosen model
for the dataset.
